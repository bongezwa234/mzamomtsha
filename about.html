                    <p>Everyone faces challenges in life, but the capacity to overcome hardships, learn from mistakes, and forge ahead in the face of immense adversity is a quality inherent in most successful individuals.
                        The obstacles facing Mzamomtsha students are daunting daily exposure to drugs, alcoholism, hunger, abuse, negative role models, violence and suffering but every day our students come to school, learn, and set their sights on a better tomorrow. They have dreams, and while at Mzamomtsha their aspiration is to make those dreams become reality.
                         We celebrate their determination and courage. They are breaking through the barriers of poverty to build a new and better life for themselves and a future for their families. They are our heroes, and role models for others to follow.</p>
